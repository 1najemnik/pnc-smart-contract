# Puzzle NFT Crafter Contract

This repository contains the smart contract for the **Puzzle NFT Crafter** game, built on the Ethereum-compatible blockchain. The game allows players to assemble one of 6,265 unique puzzles, each generated by the **Stable Diffusion** algorithm. Once a puzzle is completed, it can be saved as an NFT on the **Polygon blockchain**.

## Features

- **ERC-721 Compliant**: The contract is based on the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.
- **Unique Puzzles**: Players can assemble one of 6,265 unique puzzles generated by the **Stable Diffusion** algorithm.
- **Mint NFTs**: Once a puzzle is assembled, players can mint an NFT representing that puzzle and store it on the Polygon blockchain.
- **Signature Validation**: Minting requires a valid signature, making the process secure and preventing unauthorized actions.
- **Customizable URI**: Each minted NFT has a customizable URI that can point to specific metadata (e.g., image, description, etc.).
- **Mainnet Deployment**: Configured for deployment on Ethereum-compatible blockchains such as Polygon.
